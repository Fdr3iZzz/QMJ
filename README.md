Trying to bring the qmj to rss and maybe later a website
### How:
uses discord selfbot to fetch content and then generates RSS feed based on that

### ToDo:
- expose xml file to web
- conform to rfc4287
- convert date
- get title (from YouTube or Spotify)
- get image (from YouTube or Spotify)
- find solution with links (could use message link or YouTube/ Spotify link)
